### Guidelines
- Keep it simple. Don't use Python black belt moves. Your pull request will be
rejected if your code is difficult to read--even if it works.
- Don't use the R ggplot2 package as an implementation reference. I can't stress
 this enough (this is not a knock against ggplot2 or the coding style). Just think
 about what you'd be doing. You'd be trying to make Python behave like R. Now
 that's just sacreligious. Just be careful. Often times pull requests that violate
 this rule also violate the "no black belt moves" policy.
- Do less. Try to keep any incoming pull requests small.
- Any new functionality should have an accompanying IPython Notebook in the
[`docs/`](./docs) folder.
